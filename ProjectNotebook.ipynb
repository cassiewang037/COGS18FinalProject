    "Recently, I got really into buying League of Ledgens related fan-arts, specifically metal badges. Because it is a very small community, !they have to rely on group chats on Instant Messengers. Even though there are programs that help with adding orders, it is not working for some reasons lately and people who organize them also need external tool like Excel. I decide to come up with my own program.\n",

There are usually people in the community who will initiate a project and other who are interested can also participate. They will talk to the factories about the design and making mold and samples. \n",

    "Each badges can have different colors or style -- the one I showed have the same design but in red and blue while some have glitters. By first inputing the number of color or style they have, the code can help you create a catalog of color and its price. Then the list of order can be create by inputing how much product in each color the customer wants. Because the fan art involve copyrights, they have to be non-profit. Hence, the fee of paying designer and making badges in the factory is splited among every customer who purchase the product. The returned list is the total price with splited fee. So the customer have to pay the split, including mold and design fee, delivery fee and actual price of the products. When customers make payment, by inputing how much they paid, a list of payment can be created. It does not have to be in the same order as the order list. Another list is created combing two lists if the customer ID is the same. It will send reminder to customer who does not pay the extract price. Since it is in a group chats, in the reminder part of comparing the order and payment, I use '@' so that they can directly copy and paste this in the group chats. "
